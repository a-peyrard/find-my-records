# Find my records

> Small project to find records in `gpx` file.

## Why?
I love to run, and to analyze my data after,
I'm very frustrated by the lack of options available in strava or garmin-connect apps.
So I had a small need few weeks ago, to know what was my best miles on a run, and as
I didn't manage to find an app to extract this kind of statistics, I just made one.

This is my first time playing with `typescript`, so it's also some sort of kata.
So I will enjoy some reviewing! I have a long `java` background, so I guess I'm influenced by it. 

## How to run
It requires `npm` and `node`.
```
$ npm install -g find-my-records
$ find-my-records [a gpx file]
```

### Options
- `--distances=[dist1],[dist2]...` Permits to specify distances for records over hardcoded ones
- `--slow=true` Adds some delays in the pipeline, useful for demo with few gpx files

## From source

### Run locally
```
$ yarn install
$ ts-node src/index.ts [a gpx file]
```

### Launch the tests
```
$ yarn test
```

## TODO

As it is a kata, I guess I will go for technical improvements, before functional ones.

### Functional
~~- Specify the distances, currently they are hardcoded~~
~~- Take multiple gpx file, find individual records and global ones~~
- Display some graphs (GUI, console?) to show records evolution over the time
...

### Technical
~~- Use some stream (node?)~~
~~- Parallelize gpx file analysis~~
~~- Display records evolution as long as files are parsed (could be a cool stuff ðŸ˜€)~~
- Play with electron for the GUI
- Find some place where I could use some rxjs, just for fun 
(maybe just remove all the streams, and replace by rx!)
...

## Changelog

### 0.2.0
- Manage multiple gpx files using streams
- Allows distances configuration
- Dynamic records display while parsing files

### 0.1.3
- First version released, basically parse one file and extract the records
